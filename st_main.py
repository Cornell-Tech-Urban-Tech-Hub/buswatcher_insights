        ## BusWatcher | Insights
        ### Data Science Toolset
        BusWatcher Insights is an open source library that aims to provide researchers a 
        scaffold for data engineering and analysis. Currently it's main focus is on passenger 
        count data from the NYC bys system. The public repository is a set up to showcase 
        the best performing models and give insight into experiments. It provides utility 
        methods for fetching data, running experiments for building prediction models and a
        standardized evaluation suite.
            
        The work presented here was born of an endeavor to study the impact of weather data 
        on bus rider volume. Over the course of the project, the team had built up a substantial 
        data engineering code base. After many challenges with the initial study direction, 
        the team decided to refactor and rebuild the code base into a user-friendly public 
        library. 
            
        The library is modular and sufficiently flexible to serve a data science workflow, 
        allowing a researcher to audit data, perform feature selection, compare models, and 
        present findings, in a manageable, piecemeal fashion without much overhead.
        BusWatcher Insights is powered by NYC BusWatcher and other publicly available Urban 
        data sources. It is a collaboration between students at Cornell Tech and the Urban 
        Tech Hub.
